                This website is my final project!

                <h2>Project Background</h2>
                <p>
                    I chose this project because I wanted to use coding projects to solve problems and to become more passionate about coding.

                    For the first project, I thought I could conduct three surveys for my thematic summative and write an article for it.
                    And about the data visualizer project (the second project)? I wanted to solve this problem: So, you have the data, but 
                    reading it takes a lot of time, especially if there's a lot of it. One mistake, and you have to start over; it takes too long. 
                    Instead, I created an application that checks and provides data more quickly.
                </p>

            <div class="project-goal">
                <h2>Project Goal</h2>
                <p>
                    The goal of my project is to create a portfolio website where I do 2 coding projects using Python (the website will also use HTML).
                </p>
                <ul class ="goal-list">
                    <li>I created an article about the data from the Bio-preneur Summative Project (I used code to gather data on what yogurt students like and the most popular yogurt types, which I will sell).</li>
                    <li>I created an application that can check, visualize, and present the data generated (using Kivy and Python).</li>
                    <li>I created an AI coach website for soft skills (as a solution for people learning soft skills).</li>
                    <li>I created a portfolio website that connects all my projects.</li>
                </ul>
